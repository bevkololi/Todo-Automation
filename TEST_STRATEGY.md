# Test Strategy Document

## Overview

This document outlines the testing approach for the Todo Automation application, a full-stack web application consisting of a React frontend and Node.js backend API.

## What is Being Tested

### Application Components
- **Backend API**: Node.js/Express server with RESTful endpoints
- **Frontend Application**: React.js single-page application
- **Authentication System**: Token-based authentication
- **Database Operations**: In-memory data storage and CRUD operations
- **User Interface**: Interactive components and navigation

### Functional Areas
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Todo CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Navigation between different views (All, Pending, Completed)
- Data persistence and state management
- Error handling and validation

## Test Coverage Areas

### API Testing (Backend)
- **Authentication Endpoints**: Login validation, token generation
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete todos
- **Error Handling**: Invalid requests, authentication failures
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and response structure
- **Health Checks**: Server status and availability

### UI Testing (Frontend)
- **User Authentication**: Login form, session management
- **Todo Management**: Add, edit, delete, toggle completion
- **Navigation**: Side menu, view switching, active states
- **Data Display**: Todo lists, empty states, counts
- **User Interactions**: Form submissions, button clicks, confirmations

### Integration Testing
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: API calls from UI
- **Data Flow**: End-to-end user workflows
- **State Synchronization**: UI updates based on API responses

## Tools Used and Why

### Playwright
- **Purpose**: End-to-end UI testing
- **Why**: Cross-browser support, reliable selectors, fast execution
- **Features**: Headless mode, parallel execution, trace viewer

### Newman (Postman)
- **Purpose**: API testing and validation
- **Why**: Industry standard, comprehensive test collection, CI/CD integration
- **Features**: Environment variables, test scripts, multiple reporters

### GitHub Actions
- **Purpose**: Continuous Integration and Deployment
- **Why**: Automated testing, multi-platform support, artifact collection
- **Features**: Parallel execution, artifact storage, status reporting

## How to Run Tests

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm package manager
- Git repository access

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests Locally

#### UI Tests (Playwright)
```bash
# Run all UI tests
npm test

# Run tests in headed mode
npm run test:headed

# Run specific test file
npm test tests/specs/auth.spec.js

# Generate test report
npm run test:report
```

#### API Tests (Newman)
```bash
# Start backend server
npm run backend:dev

# Run API tests
npm run api:test

# Run API tests for CI
npm run api:test:ci
```

### CI/CD Execution
- Tests run automatically on push to any branch
- GitHub Actions executes tests on macOS with Chrome and Firefox
- Results and artifacts are available in the Actions tab

## Test Environment

### Local Environment
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3001
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox (headless mode)
- **Database**: In-memory storage

### CI Environment
- **Platform**: macOS (GitHub Actions)
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox
- **Database**: In-memory storage (fresh for each test run)

## Assumptions and Limitations

### Assumptions
- Backend server is running and accessible
- Frontend application is built and served
- Network connectivity is available
- Test data is isolated between test runs
- Authentication uses simple token-based system

### Limitations
- **Database**: In-memory storage (data not persisted between runs)
- **Authentication**: Simple username/password (admin/admin)
- **Browser Support**: Chrome and Firefox only (no Safari, Edge)
- **Platform**: macOS only in CI (no Windows/Linux testing)
- **Performance**: No load testing or performance benchmarks
- **Security**: Basic authentication (no OAuth, SSO)

### Known Constraints
- Tests require both frontend and backend servers running
- Some tests depend on specific data setup
- UI tests may be affected by rendering timing
- API tests require proper authentication flow

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Strategy
- Each test creates its own data
- Data is cleaned up after each test
- No shared state between test runs
- Unique identifiers generated for each test

### Data Isolation
- Backend data cleared between test runs
- Frontend state reset for each test
- Authentication tokens managed per test session
- No cross-contamination between test suites

## Success Criteria

### Test Execution
- All tests pass consistently
- No flaky or intermittent failures
- Reasonable execution time (< 10 minutes for full suite)
- Clear error messages and debugging information

### Coverage Goals
- 100% of API endpoints tested
- All major UI workflows covered
- Error scenarios validated
- Cross-browser compatibility verified

### Quality Metrics
- Test reliability (no false positives/negatives)
- Fast feedback loop (quick test execution)
- Maintainable test code
- Clear documentation and reporting
